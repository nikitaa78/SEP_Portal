# SEP Internal Portal

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get Started

Download/clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/nikitaa78/SEP_Portal.git
cd SEP_Portal
npm install
```

Then, create a .env file in the SEP_Portal folder and add the Firebase credentials, which can be located in the Firebase console. This is essential to connecting Firebase to the app for your local machine.

Finally, to run the app in development mode, run `npm start` or `yarn start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
